You need to adjust the colors in CMD for a more comfortable visual experience.
- 0 = Black
- 1 = Blue
- 2 = Green
- 3 = Aqua
- 4 = Red
- 5 = Purple

- 7 = Light Gray
- 8 = Dark Gray

### You should use it like "color [background][foreground]"
- Replace [background] with the color code for the background.
- Replace [foreground] with the color code for the text.
  
```bash
color 0A

color F4
```
